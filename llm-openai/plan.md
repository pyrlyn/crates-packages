### T1.6. Adopt llm-openai in cox (needs publication)

cox's `cox-provider-openai` drops its `chat`, `responses` and `wire` modules and re-exports them from this crate, so `cox_provider::openai::chat::OpenAiChatProvider` and `cox_provider::openai::responses::OpenAiResponsesProvider` keep working. The `Transport` and `ProviderModel` arguments become `llm_openai::config` values built from cox's own config types, and `cox_models::effort_for` stays cox's: `Capabilities::chat_effort` mirrors its Chat arm and the Responses wire always sends the effort. Blocked on publication of `llm-openai`, `llm-http` and `llm-wire`: cox can only depend on released crates, because a path dependency breaks cox CI. Done when cox builds against the published crates, its tests and snapshots pass unchanged, and the moved code and its fixtures are gone from `cox-provider-openai`.
