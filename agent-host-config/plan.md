### T2. Adopt agent-host-config in rtok (needs publication)

Replace `register_mcp`, `register_server`, `unregister_server`, `entry_at` and the atomic write in `rtok-agent-sdk` with this crate. It stays `publish = false` here, so rtok can depend on it only after the creator publishes it (or accepts a git dependency). Done when rtok's host installers call this crate, its own copies are deleted, and rtok's tests pass. rtok keeps its ownership check (`unregister_owned`, `judge_owned`) and its `_backup/` pruning, which are not part of this crate.
