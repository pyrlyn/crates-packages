//! Paths a git working tree changed relative to a base ref.
//!
//! The answer is the union of: commits since `git merge-base HEAD <base>`, staged and
//! unstaged edits, untracked files that are not ignored, deleted files and both sides of a
//! rename. It shells out to the `git` CLI (no shell, `-z` output) because every CI and
//! developer machine already has it, and four read-only commands do not justify a heavy
//! library such as `gix`.
//!
//! Callers that cannot trust a partial answer should treat any [`Error`] as "everything
//! changed" rather than "nothing changed".
